# REACTRIS

Tetris written in React.js. Experimenting with TDD and functional style (lots of immutable objects, only four for loops in the entire projects, not counting the tests).
Play it [here](https://fervero.github.io/reactris/).
Also, as another exercise, I rewrote the same app using redux to maintain the state. See the branch `redux` to read the code.
